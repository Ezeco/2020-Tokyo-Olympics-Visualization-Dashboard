## Project Title - PowerBI Visualization, Data Analysis for 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games

## Project Overview
The focus of this project is on analyzing the performance of countries in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which had 92 participating countries competing for medals in three categories: Gold, Silver, and Bronze. The analysis aims to identify countries with the highest and lowest medal counts, determine the number of countries that participated but did not win any medals, and predict factors contributing to the success of top-performing countries like the USA, Great Britain, Japan, and People's Republic of China. The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can help other countries improve their performance in future Olympics.

## Data Source

A CSV file containing data on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

## Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and reporting
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
  
## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using Power Query in Power BI. 
The process included:

- Standardizing the datetime format
- Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
- Replacing empty rows with appropriate values etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset comprised 93 rows and 6 columns, with the following statistical summary:

- Count: 93
- Mean: 3.655914
- Standard Deviation (std): 7.022471
- Minimum (min): varied based on the column
- Maximum (max): Varied based on the column
- 25%, 50%, and 75% Interquartile Range (IQR): Provided insights into the distribution of the data.

## Results and Findings:

- The United States won the most medals overall, while Tunisia won the fewest.
- Sixteen countries did not win any medals.
- Detailed breakdown of medals won by each country in each category (Gold, Silver, Bronze).

## Recommendations:
Based on our findings, several factors contributed to the success of top-performing countries:

- Better preparation and training
